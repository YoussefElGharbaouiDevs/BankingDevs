# BankingDevs

BankingDevs is a banking management web application, to build it I am going to use multiple technologies and programming languages such as Javascript, Bootstrap for the frontend and Php for the backend.

this  web app helps in adding details of new client such as account number and Id card, etc. It has also a features to deletion, modification of the existing client, and also provides fast searching of data and calculating of data with less time. This web app helps in optimizing the staff's productivity since almost all of the work can be done by the software.
